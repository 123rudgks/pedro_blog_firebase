# firebase 사용법을 한번 알아보고 싶어서 참고한 pedro_tech의 강의를 바탕으로 작성한 프로젝트

// can't write korean on Readme issue, written by English

right before tutorical that I 've had was making blog with full-stack. 
so I developed from client-side to server-side. 
but making project by using firebase. I felt it's really comfortable to build project without develop server-side.
of course, there would be much more benefit to build server-side by my hands, but in that case building small project. 
It would be very comfortable to use firebase cause of that I can care of client-side only. 

I think I would make toy-project by using firebase soon
